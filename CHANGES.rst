  [hvelarde]


1.1b2 (2016-05-10)
------------------

  [hvelarde]


1.1b1 (2016-04-19)
------------------

- Update view now uses batch pagination every 20 micro-updates to reduce load time for users with Editor role (closes `#10`_).
  [hvelarde]

- Depend on plone.batching; this drops support for Plone 4.2.
  [hvelarde]

- Use POST as request method on form used to add micro-updates.
  [hvelarde]

- Remove referenceable extra; Archetypes is no longer the default framework in Plone 5.
  Under Plone < 5.0 you should now explicitly add plone.app.referenceablebehavior to the `eggs` part of your buildout configuration.
  [hvelarde]

- The dates of micro-updates older than today were not shown in liveblogs on **private** and **inactive** states (fixes `#14`_).

- Editors can now edit micro-updates; a full refresh of the view will be scheduled after editing a micro-update to avoid displaying invalid content (closes `#3`_).
  [hvelarde]


1.0b2 (2014-09-13)
------------------

- An adapter listing the URLs to be purged when a Liveblog is modified was added.
  [ericof]

  [hvelarde]


1.0b1 (2014-09-05)
------------------

- Timestamp handling was simplified.
  [hvelarde]

- Implement the ``Expires`` header on ``recent-updates`` view.
  This will help us control better how long the page is going to live.

  The workflow defines 3 states: private, active and inactive.
  This way we can control when automatic refresh of micro-updates happens.

- Refresh the whole view when a micro-update has been deleted to avoid displaying invalid content.
  [hvelarde]

- The header viewlet was including the ``html`` and ``body`` tags on rendering.
  [hvelarde]
